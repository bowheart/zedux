Zedux takes Redux and dips it in React's composable architecture to achieve stateful zen.\n\nOpinionated but configurable.\n\nSimplicity rules. Zedux stores require zero configuration to start. But they're flexible and powerful enough to move with you as your app's state demands increase. Apps of all sizes, from tiny to gigantic, should be able to use Zedux comfortably.\n\nBuilding blocks of state\n\nThe store is the basic building block of application state. Stateful components that expose a Zedux store can be easily consumed and composed in any application. Zedux stores can also be easily synced across realms (workers, browser extensions, iframes, SSR).\nComposition is king.\nQuick start\nAt the most basic level, Zedux is still Redux. A reducer hierarchy drives state creation and updates. Let's get some code:\nimport { act, createStore, react } from 'zedux'\n\n/*\n  Meet your first Zedux store.\n  He's a fast, composable, predictable state container.\n  And the best part is that he's all ready to go.\n*/\nconst store = createStore()\n\n/*\n  These are actors.\n  An actor is just a function that returns an action.\n  An action is just a plain object with a \"type\" property.\n  Actions are how we tell the store to update.\n\n  (For Redux peoples): An actor is just a fancy action creator.\n*/\nconst increment = act('increment')\nconst decrement = act('decrement')\n\n/*\n  This is a reactor (in Zedux we emphasize the act-react\n  relationship between actions and reducers).\n  A reactor is just a fancy reducer.\n  A reducer is just a pure function with the signature:\n    (state, action) => state\n\n  This reactor translates the \"increment\" and \"decrement\"\n  actions into a corresponding state update by delegating\n  to sub-reducers.\n  A sub-reducer is just a reducer that doesn't control its\n  initial state and is only called for specific actions.\n*/\nconst counterReactor = react(0) // 0 - the initial state\n  .to(increment)\n  .withReducers(state => state + 1)\n\n  .to(decrement)\n  .withReducers(state => state - 1)\n\n/*\n  So we said the store is all ready to go. And that's true.\n  But in Zedux, zero configuration is optional .\n  We're not gonna use it here. But check it out in the docs.\n\n  Here we're introducing our reactor hierarchy to Zedux.\n  In this example it's a very simple one, but `store.use()`\n  actually accepts complex objects containing reactors, stores,\n  and nested objects containing reactors, stores, and...you\n  get the picture.\n*/\nstore.use(counterReactor)\n\n/*\n  Here we're subscribing to the store.\n  Zedux calls this function every time the store's state changes.\n*/\nstore.subscribe((oldState, newState) => {\n  console.log(`counter went from ${oldState} to ${newState}`)\n})\n\n/*\n  Alright! Let's take this thing for a spin!\n  We will do said spin by dispatching actions to the store.\n*/\nstore.dispatch(increment())\n// counter went from 0 to 1\nstore.dispatch(increment())\n// counter went from 1 to 2\nstore.dispatch(decrement())\n// counter went from 2 to 1\n\nIf you know Redux, almost all of this will seem familiar (and not just because the Redux docs have a similar example). At this point, you should know enough to get started using Zedux. But don't worry, there's a ton of cool stuff we haven't covered.\nHere's a small taste of what's in store (yes, that pun was an accident):\nZero configuration\nZedux stores are so dynamic, you can just create one and go. Here's what the above counter example looks like if we leverage zero configuration:\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\n/*\n  We use `store.hydrate()` to force-update the store's\n  entire state tree:\n*/\nconst store = createStore()\n  .hydrate(0) // set the initial state to 0\n\n/*\n  These are inducers.\n  Inducers are like reducers (hence the name), but have the form:\n    state => partialStateUpdate\n\n  Inducers are dispatchable - they can be passed directly to\n  `store.dispatch()`\n*/\nconst increment = state => state + 1\nconst decrement = state => state - 1\n\n/*\n  And that's it! The fun starts now.\n*/\nstore.dispatch(increment)\nstore.dispatch(decrement)\n\n/*\n  Inducers are super easy to create on the fly...\n*/\nstore.dispatch(state => state + 6)\n\n/*\n  ...but in this case we'll typically want to use `store.setState()`\n*/\nstore.setState(9)\n\nDispatching an inducer and calling store.setState() are functionally similar, but have different use cases. Inducers are nice for creating predefined state updater packages. store.setState() is nice for on-the-fly state updates – use cases are similar to React's setState().\nThe advantage of using inducers and store.setState() over store.hydrate() is that the new state is deeply merged into the existing state. Thus headaches like:\nstore.hydrate({\n  ...state,\n  todos: {\n    ...state.todos,\n    urgent\n  }\n})\n\nbecome simple:\nstore.setState({\n  todos: { urgent }\n})\n\n// or, with an inducer:\nstore.dispatch(() => ({\n  todos: { urgent }\n}))\n\nsince Zedux clones the nested nodes for us.\n\nYou may have noticed that the branch nodes of our state trees are all plain objects. But Zedux can actually be taught to understand any hierarchical data type. Immutable fans rejoice and check out the guide on configuring the hierarchy.\n\nBut what about time travel??\nOoh. You're gonna love this. Zedux translates every pseudo-action into a serializable action that a store's inspectors can plug in to. store.hydrate(), store.setState(), and actions/inducers dispatched to child stores will all find a way to notify a store's inspectors of a serializable action that can be used to reproduce the state update. In short, you never have to worry about whether a state update is reproducible. Zedux has you covered.\nSee:\n\nstore.hydrate()\nthe Inducer type\nstore.setState()\nthe zero configuration guide\n\nStore composition\nToo good to be true? Think again. The store composition model of Zedux is unprecedented and extremely powerful. The Zedux store's disposable and highly performant nature combined with its uncanny time traveling ability will make you weep. With joy, of course.\nimport { act, createStore, react } from 'zedux'\n\n/*\n  While a Zedux app can have many stores, we'll typically always\n  create a single \"root\" store. This gives us the best of both\n  worlds - The time traveling ability of the singleton model\n  and the encapsulation of component-bound stores.\n*/\nconst rootStore = createStore()\n\n// A basic inducer\nconst increment = state => state + 1\n\nlet storeIdCounter = 1\n\n/*\n  A simple factory for creating a \"counter\" store and attaching\n  it to the root store's reactor hierarchy.\n*/\nconst createCounterStore = () => {\n  const storeId = storeIdCounter++\n\n  const counterStore = createStore()\n    .hydrate(0)\n\n  // Where the magic happens; tell rootStore to \"use\" counterStore\n  rootStore.use({ [`counter${storeId}`]: counterStore })\n\n  return counterStore\n}\n\n// And enjoy\nconst counter1 = createCounterStore()\nconst counter2 = createCounterStore()\n\n// We can increment each counter individually...\ncounter1.dispatch(increment)\ncounter1.dispatch(increment)\n\ncounter2.dispatch(increment)\n\n// ...or the whole lot of 'em:\nrootStore.dispatch(increment)\n\nrootStore.getState() // { counter1: 3, counter2: 2 }\n\nTreating the store as the basic application building block opens the door for embedded applications. The Zedux store is an autonomous unit that can simultaneously handle a sub-module's internal workings and present a standardized api to consumers.\nAdditionally, the ability to create stores whose lifecycle parallels the lifecycle of a component while still maintaining time-traversable state and replayable actions is an exciting new possibility that Zedux has blown wide open.\nSee:\n\ncreateStore()\nthe Store api\nthe store composition guide\n\nSelectors\nZedux ships with a basic api for creating one of the most powerful state management performance tools: Memoized selectors. A selector is just a function with the form:\nstate => derivedState\n\nIn other words, it takes a state tree and plucks a piece off of it and/or applies some transformation to it. A memoized selector is a smart selector that only recalculates its value when absolutely necessary. When a recalculation is not necessary, it returns a cached value.\nimport { select } from 'zedux'\n\n/*\n  This is a normal selector.\n  He just grabs the list of todos off the state tree.\n*/\nconst selectTodos = state => state.entities.todos\n\n/*\n  This is a memoized selector.\n  He consists of a list of input selectors and a calculator\n  function. The calculator function's arguments are the outputs\n  of the input selectors. The calculator function will only be\n  called when BOTH the state and the output of one or more\n  input selectors change.\n*/\nconst selectIncompleteTodos = select(\n  selectTodos,\n  todos => todos.filter(todo => !todo.isComplete)\n)\n\nSelectors are an absolutely necessary ingredient for well-managed state. Use them. Use them all the time. Memoized selectors carry some overhead, so only use them when the performance benefit is obvious – e.g. when iterating over a list.\nSee:\n\nselect()\nthe performance optimization guide\nthe Selector type\n\nState machines\nDon't get too excited. But yes, state machines are very powerful and yes, Zedux includes a basic implementation.\nA state machine is just a graph. The possible states are the nodes of the graph. The possible transitions between states are directed edges connecting the nodes.\nimport { state, transition } from 'zedux'\n\n/*\n  Behold the states.\n  A state is just a fancy actor.\n*/\nconst open = state('open')\nconst closing = state('closing')\nconst closed = state('closed')\nconst opening = state('opening')\n\n/*\n  Once we have our states, we create the machine by defining\n  how the machine transitions from one state to the next.\n\n  A machine is just a fancy reactor.\n*/\nconst doorMachine = transition(open)\n  .to(closing)\n  .to(opening, closed)\n\n  .from(opening)\n  .to(closing, open)\n\n  .from(closed)\n  .to(opening)\n\n/*\n  Since our doorMachine is just a very fancy reducer,\n  it's super easy to test (and just have a blast with).\n*/\ndoorMachine(open.type, closing()) // closing - valid transition\ndoorMachine(closing.type, open()) // closing - invalid transition\ndoorMachine(opening.type, open()) // open - valid transition\n\nSee:\n\nstate()\ntransition()\nthe state machine guide\nthe ZeduxMachine api\n\nTo be continued...\nAt this point you should have a pretty good idea of what Zedux is all about.

It really isn't. You may think this because Redux is so tiny. But compare it to something like Rx, which is a complete solution in its field, and Zedux is very tiny. Currently it's almost twice the size of Redux, but accomplishes way more than twice as much. In fact, given the reduced number of plugins, your app's dependencies will almost certainly be smaller with Zedux than with Redux.\nThat said, if we find that anything is not used enough to make it worth including in Zedux core, we'll definitely take it out. On the flip side, if any features are sorely needed and not included, we'll gladly consider including them. Zedux has only a faint coat of feature-creep repellent.\nContributing\nAll contributions on any level are so overwhelmingly welcome. Just jump right in. Open an issue.

Here are some ideologies they both share:\n\nA reducer hierarchy drives state creation and updates.\n\nA single store contains the state of the entire application.\n\nImmutability, immutability, immutability.\n\nUnidirectional data flow.\n\nReducer hierarchies are explicitly created.\n\nReducers are pure functions.\n\nActions and reducers have a many-to-many relationship.\n\nActions are serializable objects.\n\nDispatched actions can be observed, saved, and replayed for a time travel debugging experience.\n\n\nAnd here are some differences:\n\nStores are completely synchronous.\n\nStores are composable.\n\nBoilerplate is an option, not the norm.\n\nReducer hierarchies are declaratively created.\n\nCode splitting takes a front seat.\n\nMiddleware is gone, replaced by inspectors and processors.\n\nInspectors inspect the store, performing side effects like logging and recording actions.\n\nProcessors process specific actions, performing side effects like ajax requests and setting timeouts.\n\nAction namespacing is considered necessary and is facilitated (e.g. Zedux favors todos/add over ADD_TODO name collision nastiness).\n\n\nMultiple stores\nZedux conforms to the Redux philosophy that a single store contains the state of the entire application. But it doesn't conform to the philosophy that there should only be one store. Zedux actually encourages that self-contained pieces of state be housed in their own store. This allows for massive performance optimizations and better encapsulation.\nBut there should only be one root store. All other stores should find themselves somewhere in the hierarchy descriptor of another store. There can be exceptions, of course – Zedux stores can be composed or not composed however you wish. Having a root store is just a good rule of thumb that Redux has demonstrated to be effective for most cases.\nWhy does it try to do so much?\nIt really doesn't. Really. But we dodge the question.\nZedux offers a high-level api and performance optimizations through the roof. It does this so that apps of all sizes, from very small to gigantic, will be able to use it comfortably.\nSo why is this important?\nBecause. Apps. Scale. This is a point that Redux doesn't address at all.\nHow many small applications decided against Redux at first, then grew to the point of sorely regretting that decision? How many mid-sized applications chose Redux, then grew to the point that the verbosity became unmaintainable and the number of plugins spiked the learning curve beyond reason?\nWhile Zedux doesn't aim to eliminate plugins, it does aim to reduce their quantity. In their place, it offers a uniform, often orthogonal api across all common aspects of state management. This drastically reduces boilerplate, overall code size, and the steepness of the learning curve.\nNo more middleware?\nThis is not so much an opinionated as an experimental step \"forward\". If you've been watching the Redux community for a while, you've noticed a lot of issues revolving around the middleware system. While the Redux maintainers seem reluctant to relinquish the sacred middleware, Zedux has no such qualms.\nIn fact, the entire concept of Zedux was first formed by asking the questions: What would Redux be like with no middleware? What other systems could we come up with? What awesome possibilities would open up?\nStore composition, for example, is impossible given the asynchronous nature of middleware. Yet there are plenty of ways to go about it. Zedux picked one and it's worked great so far. Not only that, but it's simple. Very simple. Why does Redux still not have composable stores? What are we waiting for1?\nThis brings us back to the goal of Zedux: To innovate Redux. It seems like somebody decided once that \"middleware is good\" and we've been stuck there ever since. While still experimenting, Zedux believes there are plenty of thoroughly better alternatives to middleware. So let's find them!\nNotes\n1 Alright, let's cut Redux some slack. It has become so big that it's impossible for the maintainers to take many risks. If only someone would make an entirely separate library where the Redux community could experiment safely...\n"},"docs/examples.html":{"url":"docs/examples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Examples\nThis page is a good place to start learning Zedux.

But it is designed especially to be used with React and React-like libraries.\nIn this guide, we'll use React Zedux, the official React bindings for Zedux. React Zedux does all the hard stuff for us.\nOverview\nHow do Zedux stores and React components achieve stateful view awesomeness? This seems simple enough:\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst coolStore = createStore()\n  .hydrate('such coolness')\n\nfunction CoolComponent() {\n  return 'cool stuff: ' + coolStore.getState()\n}\n\nYikes! We've tightly coupled our component to a single store instance. This may be fine for a prototype or two, but it won't do in the real world. Let's do better:\nimport coolStore from './coolStore'\n\nfunction CoolComponent({ coolStore }) {\n  return 'cool stuff: ' + coolStore.getState()\n}\n\nfunction CoolParent() {\n  \n}\n\nMuch better. CoolComponent is no longer tightly coupled to a single store – it receives one dynamically via props. Now that the component is store agnostic, we can feed it a component-bound, or otherwise-dynamically-created store.\nBut wait! Now CoolParent is tightly coupled to a store!\nWell somebody's gotta be. The trick lies in isolating store-bound components and lifting them up to the lowest common parent of dependents.\nContext\nOur current store-passing approach has a big limitation – The view doesn't update when the store's state changes. How do we tell React about the update? Enter the Context:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { createContext } from 'react-zedux'\nimport coolStore from './coolStore'\n\nconst CoolContext = createContext(coolStore)\n\nfunction CoolParent() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nThis is very similar to the context api of React 16.3. In fact, that's what it's using, under the hood.\nThe  magically allows its descendants to consume the store and react to/dispatch state updates, thus avoiding the prop drilling problem and achieving total stateful happiness.\nConsuming the store\nThe Context object contains a Consumer component that we can use to consume the provided store.\nimport CoolContext from './contexts/CoolContext'\n\nfunction CoolComponent() {\n  return (\n    \n      {coolStore => coolStore.getState()}\n    \n  )\n}\n\nWe pass a render prop as the 's only child. This render prop is passed a wrapped form of the store. And it's called every time the store's state updates.\nThe end.\nNotes\nUnlike React 16.3's built-in contexts, a ReactZedux  will throw an error if used without its matching . If you really want to provide and consume the store, either explicitly include the  or use  instead. The  is just a shorthand for providing and immediately consuming the store.\nThe wrapped store passed to the Consumer's render prop contains a single additional property: state. This property will always be the current state of the store. In our last example, we could have done:\n\n  {coolStore => coolStore.state}\n\n\nor simply:\n\n  {({ state }) => state}\n\n\nand achieved the same result.\nReact Zedux also comes with Higher-Order Component equivalents of the Context's normal components. Check those out in the React Zedux Context documentation.\nIn fact, overall we took a fairly low-level approach here. Don't worry. React Zedux has a couple layers of sugar on top of this to ease store api creation, provision, and consumption. Check it out!\n"},"docs/guides/theReducerLayer.html":{"url":"docs/guides/theReducerLayer.html","title":"The Reducer Layer","keywords":"","body":"The Reducer Layer\nThe reducer layer is one of the 3 layers of a Zedux store.\nWhen an action is dispatched to the store, the reducer layer is always the second layer hit – after the inspectors but before the processors.\nThe reducer layer's purpose is to turn actions into state. The reducer layer is a tree of composed reducers and their sub-reducers. When an action is dispatched to a store, Zedux calls the store's \"root\" reducer to calculate the new state.\nBuilding the hierarchy\nLet's build a hierarchy by hand – 'cause we're gonna pretend we like being old-school:\n// We'll take a couple sub-reducers...\nconst subReducers = {\n  buy: (state, item) => [ ...state, item ]\n  sell: (state, soldItem) => state.filter(item => item !== soldItem)\n}\n\n// ...and a reducer...\nconst potionsReducer = (state = [ 'health' ], action) =>\n  subReducers[action.type]\n    ? subReducers[action.type](state, action.payload)\n    : state\n\n// ...and a root reducer composed of our reducer\n// Note that this reducer will return a new object every time\n// it's called. This is not what we want, but for simplicity...\nconst rootReducer = (state = {}, action) => ({\n  potions: potionsReducer(state.potions, action)\n})\n\nWell, that was certainly the definition of boilerplate. But we can see from this that a reducer hierarchy consists of:\n\nBranch nodes - Like the rootReducer in this example. The branch nodes in the hierarchy are reducers that take other reducers and create a single object (or whatever data type) whose properties are controlled by individual reducers.\n\nLeaf nodes - Like the potionsReducer in this example. These are reducers that control their own initial state and decide what to do for any given action. Leaf nodes aren't composed of any other reducers, though they may delegate to sub-reducers.\n\nSub-reducers - These are reducers that typically handle exactly one action type. Sub-reducers don't define their initial state; they rely on their parent reducer to do that for them. As such, these aren't really part of the hierarchy at all, but an implementation detail of the reducers that delegate to them.\n\n\nTurning it up\nAlright, so that was fun and educational. But we'll probably never do that by hand in Zedux. Let's turn up the awesomeness:\nWe'll start with the fun part. In Zedux, we react to action types withReducers:\nimport { react } from 'zedux'\n\nconst potionsReactor = react([ 'health' ])\n  .to('buy')\n  .withReducers((state, { payload }) => [ ...state, payload ])\n\n  .to('sell')\n  .withReducers(\n    (state, { payload }) => state.filter(item => item !== payload)\n  )\n\nNote that react() accepts the initial state as its only argument. It also returns a reactor. This is just a fancy reducer.\nNow we just need to put it all together:\nconst rootHierarchy = {\n  potions: potionsReactor\n}\n\nYep, in Zedux we don't need to reduce everything down to a root reducer. Zedux will handle the branch nodes for us. This rootHierarchy object is all ready to be passed in to store.use():\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .use(rootHierarchy)\n\nAnd we're done! Here's all of that together (and simplified a little bit) ... (and beefed up a little bit...):\nimport { act, createStore, react } from 'zedux'\n\n// This is how we'll typically create actors.\n// An actor is just a fancy action creator.\nconst buy = act('buy')\nconst sell = act('sell')\n\nconst potionsReactor = react([ 'health' ])\n\n  // The neat thing about actors is they can be passed directly to\n  // this reactor's `.to()` method, avoiding string literals/constants:\n  .to(buy)\n  .withReducers((state, { payload }) => [ ...state, payload ])\n\n  .to(sell)\n  .withReducers(\n    (state, { payload }) => state.filter(item => item !== payload)\n  )\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .use({\n    potions: potionsReactor\n  })\n\n"},"docs/guides/theProcessorLayer.html":{"url":"docs/guides/theProcessorLayer.html","title":"The Processor Layer","keywords":"","body":"The Processor Layer\nThe processor layer is one of the 3 layers of a Zedux store. The processor and inspector layers are the pieces of Zedux that replace middleware in Redux.\nThe processor layer consists of all processors in the store's reactor hierarchy. A processor is attached to a reactor by setting it as the reactor's process property.\nWhen an action is dispatched to the store, the processor layer is always the last layer hit, after inspectors and reducers.\nPurpose\nThe processor layer is part of the side effects model of Zedux. It's used for responding to and \"processing\" specific actions. For example, a fetchTodos action would almost certainly be handled by a processor.\nProcessors are passed the store's dispatch method. Processors will often dispatch several actions.\nProcessors are passed their relevant piece of state. Thus they can conditionally handle actions depending on their current state. However, processors are shape agnostic. As such, they shouldn't rely on other pieces of the state tree. In the rare case that this is needed, an inspector can be used as a shape bound processor of sorts.\nThe gist\nThe processor layer lives parallel to the reducer layer. Zedux replaces the reducer hierarchy of Redux with a reactor hierarchy. A reactor is just a reducer with an optional process property whose value is a processor.\nProcessors created with the react api can return iterators and observables by default.\nExamples\nimport { act, createStore, react } from 'zedux'\nimport { post } from 'axios'\n\n// An actor and its sub-actors\nconst addTodo = act('addTodo')\n\naddTodo.requested = act('addTodo/requested')\naddTodo.success = act('addTodo/success')\naddTodo.failure = act('addTodo/failure')\n\n// Our processor.

It's used for logging and recording actions – e.g. for time travel debugging. It's useful for performing application-wide side effects like user session recording.\nTypically, only the root store will have inspectors.\nSince inspectors are shape bound, they can perform shape-dependent tasks that the processor layer cannot. Processors receive their own local state, but there are cases where a processor might depend on a piece of state somewhere else in the state tree. In these cases, an inspector can be used as a shape bound \"processor\" of sorts.\nThe gist\nThe inspector layer will be hit for every action and internal pseudo-action that could possibly change the state of the store. This includes hydration, induction, code splitting, normal action dispatches, and actions/pseudo-actions dispatched to child stores.\nThe goal of Zedux regarding the inspector layer is to ensure that it receives all the information necessary to re-create the store's entire state tree, including the state of all child stores.\nExamples\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst childStore = createStore()\nconst parentStore = createStore()\n\n// Register a basic logger inspector with the parent store\nparentStore.inspect(\n  (storeBase, action) => console.log('received action:', action)\n)\n\nparentStore.hydrate('b')\n// { type: '@@zedux/hydrate', payload: 'b' }\n\nparentStore.use(childStore)\n// { type: '@@zedux/recalculate' }\n\nchildStore.dispatch(() => 'c')\n/*\n  {\n    metaType: '@@zedux/delegate',\n    metaPayload: [],\n    action: { type: '@@zedux/hydrate', payload: 'c' }\n  }\n*/\n\nchildStore.dispatch({\n  type: 'cool-action',\n  payload: 'd'\n})\n/*\n  {\n    metaType: '@@zedux/delegate',\n    metaPayload: [],\n    action: { type: 'cool-action', payload: 'd' }\n  }\n*/\n\nNotes\nInspectors typically won't respond to specific actions.

Oh, definitely.\nUnidirectional? Reproducible? Time-traversable? Actually, still yes. Zedux is pretty cool like that.\nScalable? Standardized? Maintainable? Not so much.\nIn this guide, we'll explore just how truly zero-configured you want your Zedux app to be. We'll start off looking at the features of Zedux that contribute to zero configuration. Then we'll explore a few different design patterns surrounding them.\nMeet the players\nThe following Zedux features make zero configuration possible:\n\ncreateStore(). The almighty Zedux store factory takes no arguments. Just create and go.\n\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n\n\nstore.hydrate(). In a zero-configuration app, there isn't typically one single \"owner\" of each piece of state like there is in a reducer hierarchy. Thus we'll typically explicitly hydrate the store with its entire initial state tree right when we create it.\n\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .hydrate({\n    entities: {\n      todos: {\n        '1': { id: 1, text: 'never look back', isComplete: true }\n      }\n    }\n  })\n\n\nstore.setState(). Don't let the word set confuse you. This is still unidirectional data flow at its finest. store.setState() enables indulgently easy on-the-fly state updates that are still reproducible (#timetravel).\n\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .hydrate({\n    entities: {\n      todos: {}\n    }\n  })\n\nstore.setState({\n  entities: {\n    todos: {\n      '1': { id: 1, text: 'get up and stretch', isComplete: false }\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\ninducers. While store.setState() is easy and fun, it isn't very scalable. All but the smallest apps will want to avoid it in most cases. Inducers are a much more scalable design pattern that allows us to create pre-packaged, standard \"state updater\" packages.\n\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .hydrate(0)\n\nconst increment = state => state + 1\nconst decrement = state => state - 1\n\nstore.dispatch(increment) // 1\nstore.dispatch(increment) // 2\nstore.dispatch(decrement) // 1\n\nPatterns\nZedux allows for many possible state management design patterns. Which you should choose roughly correlates to the size of your application:\n\n~tiny – store.setState().\n~small – Inducers with store.setState() when appropriate.\n~small-medium – Inducers FTW.\n~medium – Reducer hierarchy with inducers when appropriate.\n~medium-large – Reducer hierarchy with separate stores branching off and state machines where appropriate.\n~large – Store hierarchy, each store using a reducer hierarchy.\n\nThese can all be mixed and matched according to your taste and fancy. The awesomeness here is that it is very easy to incrementally migrate a codebase from one pattern to another. Zedux stores, with their time traveling and async handling, will work in all possible scenarios.\nScenarios\nThese patterns are not set in stone. For example, even tiny applications may want to take advantage of multiple, composed stores. Since size is not the only factor, let's explore some scenarios where you may want to use a specific pattern.\nDynamic state\nWhen a state property can be literally anything, store.setState() can be useful even in very large applications:\nfunction handleInput(event) {\n  store.setState({\n    forms: {\n      billingInfo: {\n        firstName: event.currentTarget.value\n      }\n    }\n  })\n}\n\nstore.setState() can be used instead of reducers whose whose only job is to set the state to action.payload. The obvious downside is the risk of typos.  We can easily use inducer factories to mitigate this:\nconst setFirstName = firstName => state => ({\n  forms: {\n    billingInfo: { firstName }\n  }\n})\n\nfunction handleInput(event) {\n  store.dispatch(setFirstName(event.currentTarget.value))\n}\n\nThis is typically the advantage of using inducers over store.setState(); they create a standard, reusable entry point for updating the state.\nFixed state\nWhen a state property can only take a fixed set of values, state() can be useful for enumerating those values:\nimport { state } from 'zedux'\n\nconst asleep = state('asleep')\nconst offline = state('offline')\nconst online = state('online')\n\nWhile States are meant to be used in state machines, inducers can use them too:\nconst sleep = () => asleep.type\nconst goOffline = () => offline.type\nconst goOnline = () => online.type\n\nThis way, migrating to a reducer hierarchy later is a piece of cake:\nimport { transition } from 'zedux'\n\nconst userStatusMachine = transition(asleep)\n  .undirected(asleep, offline, online)\n\nIsolated state\nEven small applications will often find pieces of state that are totally isolated from the rest of the application. Isolated stores handle isolated state just beautifully. App size aside. A form is the glaring example here:\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\nimport { rootStore } from './store'\n\nconst formStore = createStore()\n  .hydrate({\n    firstName: ''\n  })\n\n// Not necessary, but we usually try to register all stores\n// with the root store (e.g. for time travel):\nrootStore.use({ form: formStore })\n\n// A simple event listener for a fun and complete example:\ndocument.getElementById('firstName')\n  .addEventListener('input', ({ currentTarget: { value }}) => {\n    formStore.setState({ firstName: value })\n  })\n\nIt is usually fine for isolated stores to use a zero configuration setup even in very large applications.\nThe initial state\nIn a classic reducer hierarchy, each reducer is in complete control of its state. But with zero configuration setups, we don't have that advantage. Inducers are very similar to sub-reducers in this regard. Compare:\nimport { act, react } from 'zedux'\n\nconst increment = act('increment')\n\nconst counterReactor = react(0)\n  .to(increment)\n  .withReducers(state => state + 1)\n\nvs.\nconst increment = state => state + 1\n\nWith the counterReactor, we defined the initial state as 0. The increment sub-reducer does not control its initial state. Notice that the increment inducer is exactly the same as the increment sub-reducer. As such, the inducer also does not control its initial state.\nThe solutions to this are:\n1) We could just make inducers control their initial state:\nconst increment = (state = 0) => state + 1\nconst decrement = (state = 0) => state - 1\n\nBut this isn't DRY at all. This is the worst solution.\n2) Make an adapter that controls the initial state:\nconst adapt = inducer => (state = 0) => inducer(state)\n\nconst increment = adapt(state => state + 1)\nconst decrement = adapt(state => state - 1)\n\nThis is a decent solution in certain situations, especially if we need an adapter anyway to pluck a piece off the state tree:\nconst useCounter = inducer => (\n  { counter = 0 } = {}\n) => ({ counter: inducer(counter) })\n\nconst increment = useCounter(state => state + 1)\nconst decrement = useCounter(state => state - 1)\n\nThe caveat (or feature?) of this solution is that it prevents the store from containing state that hasn't been modified yet. In the above example, the store would not contain a counter property until we dispatched an increment or decrement action to it. Probably not what we want. But maybe. Your choice.\nNote that solution 1 suffers from this as well. We just didn't mention that because it wasn't worth the effort. It is now though. For some reason.\n3) Hydrate the store with the entire initial state tree upon creation:\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .hydrate({\n    counter: 0\n  })\n\nThis solution is good enough for most cases.\n4) Dispatch probed inducer adapters:\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\nimport { useCounter } from './counter'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n\n// \"probe\" the useCounter adapter with the identity function:\nstore.dispatch(useCounter(state => state))\n\nThis is essentially a fusion of solutions 2 and 3, but with the caveat of solution 2 removed. We can, of course, optimize this for multiple adapters by composing them together. More on that in the dispatchable reducers guide.\nConclusion\npros\n\nEasy to get started – not much code to write.\n\nEasy to reason about for small applications.\n\nZedux ensures that every state update is reproducible, so our time travel debugging desires are satiated satisfactorily.\n\nUpdating the state in a zero configuration setup is much, much more efficient than a reducer setup. To update one tiny corner of state, a reducer hierarchy must traverse the whole tree – O(n). Inducers, however, pluck the piece they need and update just that – O(1). This difference probably never matters, but it's there for you to feel good about.\n\n\ncons\n\nInducers are shape bound, whereas reducers are shape agnostic.\n\nRequires either complex or composite inducers to mimic many-to-many actions-to-reducers mappings.\n\nRelying solely on inducers to update the state tree can become tedious to maintain and reason about in larger applications. This is because there is no single \"owner\" of each piece of state – we have to manually hydrate the store's initial state. Also, adapters === boilerplate. Too much of that and you might as well be wiring a reducer hierarchy.\n\n\nZero configuration is easy by default. But the easiest solutions are also the least scalable. Pick your patterns and standards carefully. But don't worry too much. Zedux will flex with you as you scale.\n"},"docs/guides/dispatchableReducers.html":{"url":"docs/guides/dispatchableReducers.html","title":"Dispatchable Reducers","keywords":"","body":"Dispatchable Reducers\nZedux allows reducers to be dispatched directly to the store in place of actions. These reducers have the form:\n(state: S) => P\n\nAh! But wait! Real reducers also take an action param and return the entire state tree:\n(state: S, action: Action) => S\n\nSo let's get some terminology straight first. Dispatchable \"reducers\" are not reducers at all. They map the current state to a partial state update and don't involve an action. Since they are inspired by reducers and functionally similar, we will refer to them as \"Inducers\". That is what they do after all – induce state updates.\nInducers\nRead up on the pros and cons of inducers in the zero configuration guide.\nThe cool thing about inducers in comparison to reducers is that they can return a partial state update. This means that headaches like:\nstore.hydrate({\n  ...state,\n  todos: {\n    ...state.todos,\n    urgent\n  }\n})\n\nbecome simple:\nstore.dispatch(() => ({\n  todos: { urgent }\n}))\n\nInducers require a few techniques to meet their full potential. Let's go over the most important ones:\nTechniques\nLet's look at a normal inducer first:\nconst increment = state => state + 1\n\nstore.dispatch(increment)\n\nSo this is nice and easy, but it isn't configurable, extensible, or scalable. Let's look at a few techniques we can use to make inducers awesome:\nInducer factories\nThese are analogous to action creators. Note the currying:\nconst addTodo = text => state =>\n  [ ...state, { text, isComplete: false } ]\n\nstore.dispatch(addTodo('take the road more traveled'))\n\nIn other words, it's a function that returns a configured inducer.\nShape abstraction\nThe real purpose of zero configuration is to allow small applications to take advantage of Zedux. But as your app scales, you should probably move to a reducer hierarchy setup.\nSince reducers are shape agnostic, it is important to abstract out the state boundedness of inducers as much as possible. This will make it easier to port the existing inducer \"hierarchy\" to a reducer hierarchy.\nTo do this, we'll make use of a shape abstraction called an adapter.\n/*\n  Here's our adapter.\n\n  This guy just abstracts out the fact that the \"todos\" array\n  lives inside a \"todos\" property on the root store object.\n*/\nconst todosAdapter = inducer => state => ({\n  todos: inducer(state.todos)\n})\n\n/*\n  Here's our normal inducer factory.\n\n  This is the entity we may one day split into an action\n  creator and real reducer.\n*/\nconst addTodo = newTodo => todosAdapter(\n  state => [ ...state, newTodo ]\n)\n\nComposite inducers\nInducers don't have to return a partial state update. We can make them return the whole tree. This gives them the form: State => State. Oh, snap...Must...Compose. Use this technique to update multiple separate but dependent pieces of the state tree at once:\nimport { compose, createStore } from 'zedux'\nimport { selectWeaponPrice } from './selectors'\n\n// Some setup for this example\nconst buyWeapon = weaponName => state => ({\n  ...state,\n  weapons: [ ...state.weapons, weaponName ]\n})\n\nconst spendGold = amount => state => ({\n  ...state,\n  gold: state.gold - amount\n})\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .hydrate({\n    gold: 200,\n    weapons: [ 'dagger' ]\n  })\n\n// Our composite inducer. 'broadsword' hard-coded for this example\nconst buyAndSpend = compose(\n  buyWeapon('broadsword'),\n  spendGold(selectWeaponPrice('broadsword'))\n)\n\nstore.dispatch(buyAndSpend)\n\nThis technique can also be used to set the initial state of the store with probed inducer adapters:\nimport { compose, createStore } from 'zedux'\n\n// Some setup for this example\nconst todosAdapter = inducer => (state = {}) => ({\n  ...state,\n  todos: inducer(state.todos || [])\n})\n\nconst visibilityFilterAdapter = inducer => (state = {}) => ({\n  ...state,\n  visibilityFilter: inducer(state.visibilityFilter || 'showAll')\n})\n\nconst store = createStore()\n\n// We'll use the identity function to \"probe\" our inducer adapters\nconst prober = state => state\n\n// Create the inducer that'll set the store's initial state\nconst hydrater = compose(\n  todosAdapter,\n  visibilityFilterAdapter\n)(prober)\n\nstore.dispatch(hydrater)\n\nBut inducers aren't serializable! What about time travel?\nActually, it's still possible. After calculating the new state, Zedux will dispatch the special partial hydrate action to the store, which inspectors can plug in to. Zedux always has this covered! All non-serializable or otherwise non-standard actions are transformed into a serializable action that has all the information a time travel implementation needs.\nThis gives Zedux a big boost up from other zero-configuration Redux libraries like Repatch and Redux-Zero.\nRefactoring\nEventually our app may grow to the point where we need the scalability of a reducer hierarchy. Well-made inducer hierarchies are very easy to incrementally migrate to a reducer hierarchy setup.\nLet's take the addTodo inducer factory from our shape abstraction example above and port it over to a reducer hierarchy. Here it is again:\nconst addTodo = newTodo => todosAdapter(\n  state => [ ...state, newTodo ]\n)\n\nLet's create the action creator first:\nconst addTodo = newTodo => ({\n  type: 'addTodo',\n  payload: newTodo\n})\n\nAnd the reducer:\n// Just add the initial state and the action parameter\nconst addTodoReducer = (state = [], { payload: newTodo }) =>\n  [ ...state, newTodo ]\n\nAnd that's really all there is to it! You can see how much of that was copy-paste. But the Zedux api makes this even easier. Here's a complete example using Zedux actors and reactors:\nimport { act, createStore, react } from 'zedux'\n\nconst addTodo = act('addTodo')\n\nconst addTodoReactor = react([])\n  .to(addTodo)\n  .withReducers(\n    (state, { payload: newTodo }) => [ ...state, newTodo ]\n  )\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .use({\n    todos: addTodoReactor\n  })\n\nAnd that's everything. In 8 lines of code, we made an action creator, reactor, reducer, store, and reactor hierarchy and wired them all together.\n"},"docs/guides/harnessingStateMachines.html":{"url":"docs/guides/harnessingStateMachines.html","title":"Harnessing State Machines","keywords":"","body":"Harnessing State Machines\nZedux ships with basic support for one of the simplest yet most powerful mechanisms for managing state: State machines.\nA state machine is just a graph. The possible states are the nodes of the graph. The possible state transitions are directed edges connecting the nodes.\nFor example, a machine with 4 states:\n\na\nb\nc\nd\n\n(where \"a\" is the start state) and the following edges:\n\na -> b\na -> c\nc -> d\nd -> b\n\ncan be represented visually like so:\na  ->  b\n\n|      ^\nv      |\n\nc  ->  d\nand in Zedux like so:\nimport { transition } from 'zedux'\n\nconst machine = transition('a') // 'a' - the start state\n  .to('b', 'c') // create the a -> b and a -> c edges\n\n  .from('c')\n  .to('d') // create the c -> d edge\n  .to('b') // create the d -> b edge\n\nState machines are particularly useful in two scenarios:\nScenario 1 - Sequential state\nState machines are useful when state has a sequence or flow to it. Think a three-part form:\n\nThe user starts at step one.\nFrom step one, the user may proceed to step two.\nFrom step two, the user may:\nreturn to step one.\nproceed to step three.\n\n\nFrom step three, the user may:\nreturn to step two.\nsubmit the form.\n\n\n\nThis flow diagram would be perfectly represented as a state machine with 4 states:\n\nstepOne\nstepTwo\nstepThree\nsubmitted\n\nAnd the following edges:\n\nstepOne -> stepTwo\nstepTwo -> stepOne\nstepTwo -> stepThree\nstepThree -> stepTwo\nstepThree -> submitted\n\nWe can represent this machine easily with a Zedux machine:\nimport { state, transition } from 'zedux'\n\nconst stepOne = state('stepOne')\nconst stepTwo = state('stepTwo')\nconst stepThree = state('stepThree')\nconst submitted = state('submitted')\n\nconst machine = transition(stepOne)\n  .to(stepTwo)\n  .to(stepOne, stepThree)\n\n  .from(stepThree)\n  .to(stepTwo, submitted)\n\nScenario 2 - Fixed states\nWhile sequential state is where state machines really show their prowess, state machines are actually useful for any piece of state whose possible values are all known (\"fixed\"). Think a group of radio buttons that control a filter over a list of todos:\n\nBy default, all todos are visible.\nThe user may select a filter to see only complete todos.\nThe user may select a filter to see only incomplete todos.\nThe user may remove the filter to see all todos.\n\nThis filter can be represented as a state machine with 3 states:\n\nshowAll\nshowComplete\nshowIncomplete\n\nAnd the following edges:\n\nshowAll -> showComplete\nshowAll -> showIncomplete\nshowComplete -> showAll\nshowComplete -> showIncomplete\nshowIncomplete -> showAll\nshowIncomplete -> showComplete\n\nWe can introduce the concept of undirected edges to simplify this:\n\nshowAll  showComplete  showIncomplete  showAll\n\nZedux machines handle this scenario perfectly:\nimport { state, transition } from 'zedux'\n\nconst showAll = state('showAll')\nconst showComplete = state('showComplete')\nconst showIncomplete = state('showIncomplete')\n\nconst machine = transition(showAll)\n  .undirected(showAll, showComplete, showIncomplete)\n\nProcessing\nHere we're talking about the store's processor layer. You may want to read up on that if you haven't already.\nThis is a fascinating aspect of state machines. States define how they should be processed. Each state can have an enter and/or leave hook. These hooks are processors. They are called when the machine enters or leaves the given state, respectively. Specifically, they are called when the store's processor layer is hit after the store's reducer layer causes the machine to transition from one state to another.\nConsider the following example:\nimport { createStore, state, transition } from 'zedux'\n\n// Create our states\nconst idle = state('idle')\nconst fetchTodos = state('fetchTodos')\n  .onEnter(async (dispatch, action) => {\n    try {\n      const result = await fetch('/api/todos')\n\n      dispatch(fetchTodos.success(result))\n    } catch (err) {\n      dispatch(fetchTodos.failure(err))\n    }\n  })\n\nfetchTodos.success = state('fetchTodos', 'success')\nfetchTodos.failure = state('fetchTodos', 'failure')\n\n// Define the transitions between our states\nconst fetchTodosMachine = transition(idle)\n  .to(fetchTodos)\n  .to(fetchTodos.success, fetchTodos.failure)\n\n// Create a store for this example\nconst store = createStore({\n  fetchTodosStatus: fetchTodosMachine\n})\n\n// Dispatch some actions\nstore.dispatch(fetchTodos())\n\n// The machine is already in the \"fetchTodos\" state.\n// This will have no effect:\nstore.dispatch(fetchTodos())\n\nZedux will ensure that the attached enter hook gets called when the fetchTodosMachine enters the fetchTodos state. This hook will asynchronously fetch some data and dispatch actions that further transition the state of the machine.\nThis example also illustrates another useful feature of state machines: This machine can only send one request. Once it enters the fetchTodos state, nothing can ever cause it to enter that state again. In React, for example, this means we could mount multiple components at once that all attempt to fetchTodos. Only the first one will actually trigger a request, but all components can access the fetched data.\nAliasing transitions\nIn Zedux we don't necessarily bother naming the edges of the state machine graph. But semantically this may be desirable. We can alias target states as transition names to mimic this effect:\nimport { state } from 'zedux'\n\n// \"isFetchingTodos\" is clearly the name of a state, but it's\n// rather awkward calling it as a function; such a function would\n// normally return a boolean, but this returns an action object:\nconst isFetchingTodos = state('isFetchingTodos')\n\n// To overcome this, we can alias the state name as a\n// \"transition\" - the action that's actually taking place:\nexport const fetchTodos = isFetchingTodos\n\nNow this is more semantically correct; another file doesn't need to know the name of the target state, it just needs to know the name of the action it takes to get there:\nimport { fetchTodos } from './store/todos'\n\nstore.dispatch(fetchTodos())\n\n"},"docs/guides/storeComposition.html":{"url":"docs/guides/storeComposition.html","title":"Store Composition","keywords":"","body":"Store Composition\nThis is easily the coolest part of Zedux. The store composition model of Zedux is unprecedented and extremely powerful.\nIn this guide, we'll start off talking about the concepts of store composition at a very high level (complete with pictures!). We'll then translate our high level examples into real Zedux stores.\nThis guide will assume you're at least moderately familiar with the inspector layer of Zedux stores. So read up on that if you haven't.\nBehold the awesomeness\nLet's work with the following store setup:\n\n\nTo be clear, this means that Store A and Store B appear somewhere in the Hierarchy Descriptor of the Root Store, and Store C appears somewhere in the Hierarchy Descriptor of Store B.\n\nHopefully your mind is reeling right now. Here are a few questions we'll answer in this guide:\n\n\"What happens if I dispatch an action to the Root Store? Store A? B? C?\"\n\"How does the Root Store know of a change in Store C?\"\n\"What if I dispatch an inducer to the Root Store?\"\n\"What if I hydrate the state of Store B?\"\n\"How can time travel debugging possibly still work?\"\n\nLet's get this party started.\nWhat happens if I dispatch an action to the Root Store?\nZedux wraps all child stores in reactors. Thus an action dispatched to the Root Store will find its way down the reactor hierarchy to each child store's wrapper reactor.\nWhen a child store's wrapper reactor is hit, it dispatches a special INHERIT action to the child store. This INHERIT action is just the original action wrapped in a meta node. Let's get some visuals:\n\n\nWe'll use red arrows to indicate downward flow and a red box to indicate that an action is wrapped in the special INHERIT meta type.\n\nThese wrapped actions behave exactly like normal actions, except that the child store's inspectors can see that the action is inherited. Zedux uses this internally to ensure that the action doesn't propagate back up the chain. But most inspector tasks will want to ignore inherited actions.\nGood so far? Let's continue.\nWhat happens if I dispatch an action to Store A?\nHmm. Let's think about this. The Root Store's inspectors need to be notified of the action so that it can implement time travel debugging. The action should be dispatched to Store A normally. If Store A's state changes, the Root Store also needs to be notified of that state change. The Root Store then needs to propagate that change through its own internal state and notify its own subscribers of the change.\nThus there are two things the Root Store needs to do:\n1) Inspect Store A's actions\nParent stores register an inspector with their child stores. When an action is dispatched to a child store, the parent's inspector is notified and propagates the notification to the parent store's inspectors. And so on up the chain.\nThe key here is that the parent store wraps the action in a special DELEGATE meta node before passing it up the chain. This meta node contains all the information the parent store needs to \"delegate\" the action to the child store. The idea here is that dispatching an action to a child store is exactly equivalent to dispatching a configured DELEGATE action to the parent store.\nThis allows the Root Store to plug in to all actions dispatched to all child stores in such a way that the Root Store can easily reproduce all state changes across the whole hierarchy. Since this is recursive, even deeply nested stores can have their state easily reproduced by any store up the chain (including itself). This is the key to time travel.\nNote that the action is not dispatched to the parent store. Only the inspectors of the parent store (and grandparent store, and great-grandparent store, etc...) are notified.\n2) Subscribe to changes in Store A\nParent stores also subscribe to changes in their child stores. When a child's state changes, the parent reconstructs the state hierarchy down the child store's path (that's just basic immutability). The parent store then notifies its subscribers of the state change. And so on up the chain.\n\n\nWe'll use green arrows to indicate upward flow and a green box to indicate that an action is wrapped in the special DELEGATE meta type.\n\nNote that Store B and Store C are not touched in the slightest. This is the beastly performance benefit of Zedux.\nWhat happens if I dispatch an action to Store B?\nNow we're getting somewhere. Take a wild guess at what happens in this case.\nThis case is just a combination of the two previous examples:\n\nNote again that Store A is not touched. Beautiful.\nWhat happens if I dispatch an action to Store C?\nOoh. This part's fun. If you were paying attention, you should already know what happens in this case. But this diagram is just too fun:\n\nRemember the key to time travel:\n\nThe idea here is that dispatching an action to a child store is exactly equivalent to dispatching a configured DELEGATE action to the parent store.\n\nThe same goes for grandchild and great-grandchild stores (and so on...). An action dispatched to a store is exactly equivalent to dispatching a configured DELEGATE action to its parent store. It's also exactly equivalent to dispatching a doubly-wrapped DELEGATE action to its grandparent store or a triply-wrapped DELEGATE action to its great-grandparent store. And so on forever.\nZedux takes special care to ensure that every store can reproduce every last bit of its state.\nUnwinding\nLet's dispatch a doubly-wrapped DELEGATE action to the Root Store and see what happens:\n\nLet's walk through this one:\n\n[action dispatched to Root Store]\n\nRoot Store: \"Oh, delegate to Store B, huh? You got it.\"\n\n[Root Store unwraps the \"delegate\" instruction and dispatches the result to Store B]\n\nStore B: \"Oh, delegate to Store C, huh? Fine...\"\n\n[Store B unwraps the \"delegate\" instruction and dispatches the result to Store C]\n\nStore C: \"Oh look, a normal action. Inform my inspectors! Call out the reducers and hit up the processors! Long live Zedux!\"\n\n\nNote that the action is dispatched to Store C normally. Store C has no idea where it came from. Thus the action will actually travel back up the inspector chain, being wrapped in DELEGATE meta nodes as normal.\nAlso note that Store A is still completely untouched. Ah, Zedux.\nHow does the Root Store know of a change in Store C?\nWe've answered this one. Recall:\n\nParent stores also subscribe to changes in their child stores. When a child's state changes, the parent reconstructs the state hierarchy down the child store's path (that's just basic immutability). The parent store then notifies its subscribers of the state change. And so on up the chain.\n\nThus state changes in a child store are propagated up to parent store subscriptions. I think a simple image will suffice:\n\nWhat if I dispatch an inducer to the Root Store?\nSince an inducer is essentially just a partial state hydration – in fact, an inducer causes the special hydrate action to be dispatched – we'll answer this question with the next one.\n\nNote that when an inducer is dispatched to a parent store, the state update loses its advantage of being an O(1) operation; the parent store will still send the action through its reducer and processor layers in order to inform its child stores of the state update.\n\nWhat if I hydrate the state of Store B?\nThe hydration will create the special hydrate action, wrap it in a DELEGATE meta node, and inform the Root Store's inspectors. During hydration, Store C will also be hydrated with the appropriate slice of state. Once the state is updated, the state change in Store B will be propagated to the Root Store.\n\nAnd so on down and up the chain. Sick, huh?\nHow can time travel debugging possibly still work?\nWe've probably answered this satisfactorily, but just to review:\nZedux takes special care to make sure that a store's inspectors are called every time the store's state may change. So store.hydrate(), inducers, and actions dispatched to child stores will all find a way to notify the store's inspectors of a serializable action that can be used to reproduce the state update.\nTypically, time travel will be implemented in the Root Store's inspectors. But every store has the capability.\nWith code\nLet's demonstrate a couple of these scenarios with actual Zedux code. We'll make Store A and Store C (our \"leaf\" nodes) use a simple counter reducer as their root reactor:\nreducers/counter.js\nimport { act, react } from 'zedux'\n\nexport const increment = act('increment')\n\nexport default react(0)\n  .to(increment)\n  .withReducers(state => state + 1)\n\nNow let's create Store A:\nstores/storeA.js\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\nimport counter from '../reducers/counter'\n\nexport default createStore()\n  .use({\n    counterA: counter\n  })\n\nAnd Store C (basically the same thing):\nstores/storeC.js\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\nimport counter from '../reducers/counter'\n\nexport default createStore()\n  .use({\n    counterC: counter\n  })\n\nLet's make Store B a little more interesting. We'll nest Store C deep (alright, not too deep) in Store B's hierarchy descriptor:\nstores/storeB.js\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\nimport storeC from './storeC'\n\nexport default createStore()\n  .use({\n    nested: {\n      store: storeC\n    }\n  })\n\nNow let's glue it all together in our Root Store:\nstores/rootStore.js\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\nimport storeA from './storeA'\nimport storeB from './storeB'\n\nexport default createStore()\n  .use({\n    a: storeA,\n    b: storeB\n  })\n\nSweet! Let's take it for a spin:\nindex.js\nimport rootStore from './stores/rootStore'\n\nrootStore.getState() /* ->\n  {\n    a: {\n      counterA: 0\n    },\n    b: {\n      nested: {\n        store: {\n          counterC: 0\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n*/\n\nBefore we get too crazy, let's register an inspector with the Root Store and Store B and let's subscribe to changes on the Root Store:\nindex.js\nimport rootStore from './stores/rootStore'\nimport storeB from './stores/storeB'\n\nrootStore.inspect((storeBase, action) => {\n  console.log('Root Store inspector received action', action)\n})\n\nrootStore.subscribe((newState, oldState) => {\n  console.log('Root Store state updated', newState)\n})\n\nstoreB.inspect((storeBase, action) => {\n  console.log('Store B inspector received action', action)\n})\n\nNow we can go crazy:\ncrazy.js\nimport { increment } from './reducers/counter'\nimport rootStore from './stores/rootStore'\n\nrootStore.dispatch(increment())\n\n/*\n  Logs:\n\n  Root Store inspector received action {\n    type: 'increment'\n  }\n\n  Store B inspector received action {\n    metaType: '@@zedux/inherit',\n    action: {\n      type: 'increment'\n    }\n  }\n\n  Root Store state updated {\n    a: {\n      counterA: 1\n    },\n    b: {\n      nested: {\n        store: {\n          counterC: 1\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n*/\n\n\nWe simplified these logs. There will actually be another log and the Store B log will actually have another meta node on it. Store B's inspectors receive an inherited action from the Root Store's reducer layer and an inherited action from the Root Store's processor layer. Usually you'll want to just ignore inherited actions.\n\nHow about an action dispatched to Store C?\ncrazy2.js\nimport { increment } from './reducers/counter'\nimport storeC from './stores/storeC'\n\nstoreC.dispatch(increment())\n\n/*\n  Logs:\n\n  Store B inspector received action {\n    metaType: '@@zedux/delegate',\n    metaPayload: [ 'nested', 'store' ],\n    action: {\n      type: 'increment'\n    }\n  }\n\n  Root Store inspector received action {\n    metaType: '@@zedux/delegate',\n    metaPayload: [ 'b' ],\n    action: {\n      metaType: '@@zedux/delegate',\n      metaPayload: [ 'nested', 'store' ],\n      action: {\n        type: 'increment'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  Root Store state updated {\n    a: {\n      counterA: 1\n    },\n    b: {\n      nested: {\n        store: {\n          counterC: 2\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n*/\n\n\nWe simplified these logs too. To see the real output, play with this codepen.\n\nHere you can see the nested DELEGATE meta nodes and their data.\nConclusion\nWell, that was fun. There are plenty of other scenarios we didn't get to, but this should shed enough light on the store composition model of Zedux to get you started. The store setup we used here is all ready to go in this codepen if you want to have a fiddle.\nApart from the obvious performance benefits, we didn't really cover the motivation behind composable stores. That'll have to wait for another article. For now, I hope you can see that the store tree more closely resembles a component hierarchy in Redux, Vue, Angular, or other such component-based libraries. The ability to create stores whose lifecycle parallels the lifecycle of a component while still maintaining time-traversable state and replayable actions is an exciting new possibility that Zedux has blown wide open.\n"},"docs/guides/configuringTheHierarchy.html":{"url":"docs/guides/configuringTheHierarchy.html","title":"Configuring the Hierarchy","keywords":"","body":"Configuring the Hierarchy\nBy default, the reactor hierarchy created by Zedux will return a JavaScript object for every branch node found in the hierarchy descriptor passed to the store. So:\nstore.use({ // this object is a b node\n  a: () => 1\n})\n\ncreates a reactor hierarchy that'll return the following state:\n{\n  a: 1\n}\n\nBut what if we don't want an object? Say we want to enforce immutability in our store and use an immutable Map as the intermediate nodes. We could build our own reactor hierarchy from scratch, but then we might as well be using plain Redux. Here's where store.setNodeOptions() comes in.\nThe gist\nThere are 7 functions that Zedux uses to work with state tree nodes:\n\nclone - A function that accepts a node and returns a clone (shallow copy) of that node.\n\ncreate - A function that returns a new, empty node.\n\nget - A function that accepts a node and key and returns the value of key in node.\n\nisNode - A function that accepts anything and returns a boolean indicating whether the given argument is a node.\n\niterate - A function that accepts a node and a callback function and iterates over all the key-value pairs, passing them to the callback function as callback(key, value).\n\nset - A function that accepts a node, a key, and a value and sets the value of key to value in node.\n\nsize - A function that accepts a node and returns its size – an integer representing the number of key-value pairs contained in the node.\n\n\nThe default value of all these is pretty straight-forward:\nconst defaultNodeOptions = {\n  clone: node => { ...node },\n\n  create: () => ({}),\n\n  get: (node, key) => node[key],\n\n  isNode: isPlainObject, // (an internal helper function)\n\n  iterate: (node, callback) => {\n\n    // Iterate over the object's entries and pass each pair off\n    // to the callback function\n    Object.entries(node).forEach(\n      ([ key, val ]) => callback(key, val)\n    )\n  },\n\n  set: (node, key, val) => {\n    node[key] = val\n\n    return node\n  },\n\n  size: node => Object.keys(node).length\n}\n\nThis is the stuff that tells Zedux how to work with plain objects as the intermediate nodes in the reactor hierarchy. But using store.setNodeOptions(), we can teach Zedux how to use something else.\nImplementing\nLet's teach Zedux a new data type. We'll use the Map class from ImmutableJS for this example:\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\nimport { Map } from 'immutable'\n\nconst nodeOptions = {\n  clone: node => node,\n\n  create: () => new Map(),\n\n  get: (node, key) => node.get(key),\n\n  isNode: node => node instanceof Map,\n\n  iterate: (node, callback) => {\n    node.forEach(\n      (val, key) => callback(key, val)\n    )\n  },\n\n  set: (node, key, val) => node.set(key, val),\n\n  size: node => node.size\n}\n\n// A simple reducer for this example\nconst counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {\n  const amount = action.type === increment.type\n\n  return state + amount\n}\n\n// And create the store\nconst store = createStore()\n  .setNodeOptions(options)\n  .use({\n    counter: counterReducer\n  })\n\n// Now the root state tree node created by Zedux will be an Immutable map:\nstore.getState().get('counter') // 0\n\nNotes\nThere are probably no reasons for overwriting just one or two options. If you specify one node option, you should definitely specify them all.\n"},"docs/guides/mergingHierarchies.html":{"url":"docs/guides/mergingHierarchies.html","title":"Merging Hierarchies","keywords":"","body":"Merging Hierarchies\n\"What happens if I merge x into y?\"\nThere are many different scenarios that we can run into when merging two hierarchy descriptors together via store.use(). This comprehensive guide will cover all of them.\nThe nodes\nThere are 4 types of hierarchy descriptors – the branch type and 3 types of leaves:\n\nBranch - This is the branch node in the tree. It's just a plain object containing other nodes. See the Branch type documentation.\n\nReactor - A leaf node. See the Reactor type documentation.\n\nStore - A leaf node. See the Store documentation.\n\nnull - A leaf node. Indicates a not-yet-created node or a node that should be removed.\n\n\nThe scenarios\nWe'll use the notation x -> y to mean \"merge a node of type x into a node of type y.\"\nGiven our 4 node types, we have the following merge scenarios:\n1. null -> null\n2. null -> Branch\n3. null -> Reactor\n4. null -> Store\n\n5. Branch -> null\n6. Branch -> Branch\n7. Branch -> Reactor\n8. Branch -> Store\n\n9. Reactor -> null\n10. Reactor -> Branch\n11. Reactor -> Reactor\n12. Reactor -> Store\n\n13. Store -> null\n14. Store -> Branch\n15. Store -> Reactor\n16. Store -> Store\nAny node in the hierarchy, including the root, may be any of these 4 types, and thus can encounter any of these 16 scenarios.\nIt may seem like a lot, but it's really pretty straightforward. Just remember the rules.\nThe rules\n\nType 6 (Branch -> Branch) recursively merges the two nodes.\n\nEverything else always overwrites the given node (if it exists).\n\nThe null -> * scenarios remove the given node.\nThe * -> null scenarios create a node.\n\n\n\nSee? Not so difficult.\nExamples\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n\n  // Reactor -> null\n  .use(aReactor) // creates the root node\n\n  // Reactor -> Reactor\n  .use(newReactor) // overwrites the root node\n\n  // Store -> Reactor\n  .use(aStore) // overwrites the root node\n\n  // Store -> Store\n  .use(anotherStore) // overwrites the root node\n\n  // Branch -> Store\n  .use({ // overwrites the root node\n    a: aReactor // creates a node\n  })\n\n  // Branch -> Branch\n  .use({ // is recursively merged into the root node\n    a: { // overwrites the \"a\" node\n      b: bStore // creates a node\n    },\n    c: cReactor // creates a node\n  })\n\n  // Branch -> Branch\n  .use({ // is recursively merged into the root node\n\n    // Reactor -> Branch\n    a: aReactor // overwrites the \"a\" node\n\n    // Branch -> Reactor\n    c: { // overwrites the \"c\" node\n      d: { // creates a node\n        e: eStore // creates a node\n      }\n    },\n\n    // Reactor -> null\n    f: fReactor // creates a node\n  })\n\n  // Branch -> Branch\n  .use({ // is recursively merged into the root node\n\n    // Branch -> Branch\n    c: { // is recursively merged into the \"c\" node\n\n      // Store -> Branch\n      d: dStore // overwrites the \"c.d\" node\n    },\n\n    // null -> Reactor\n    f: null // deletes the \"f\" node\n  })\n\nHere's our hierarchy's final shape:\n{\n  a: aReactor,\n  c: {\n    d: dStore\n  }\n}\n\nNotes\nDon't get hierarchy descriptors and the resulting reactor hierarchy confused! Here we've been talking about hierarchy descriptors. Zedux will take the hierarchy descriptor passed to store.use(), merge it with the existing hierarchy descriptor (if any), then create a reactor hierarchy with that information.\nZedux builds the reactor hierarchy using a special, internally-created intermediate reactor for every Branch node found.\nThe data type returned by the intermediate reactors can be changed with the store.setNodeOptions() api. However, a plain object is always used in the hierarchy descriptor passed to store.use().\n"},"docs/guides/metaChains.html":{"url":"docs/guides/metaChains.html","title":"Meta Chains","keywords":"","body":"Meta Chains\nMeta chains are an exciting, unique feature of Zedux. Meta chains replace the meta property on Flux Standard Actions. Though you can, of course, still add a meta property to your actions.\nThe gist\nHow about an example to start? Let's take a boring action:\nconst addTodoAction = {\n  type: 'addTodo',\n  payload: 'make a meta chain'\n}\n\nMeta chains are a standard format for meta data. Let's metafy this action:\nconst metafiedAddTodoAction = {\n  metaType: 'instructionToAllInspectors',\n  metaPayload: [ 'be', 'the', 'best' ],\n  action: {\n    type: 'addTodo',\n    payload: 'make a bigger meta chain'\n  }\n}\n\nA meta chain is a singly linked list composed of meta chain nodes. The last node in the chain must be a normal action object. All other nodes in the chain (if any) must be meta nodes.\nA meta node is very similar to a normal action object. It's an object with required metaType and action properties and an optional metaPayload property:\ninterface MetaNode {\n  metaType: string,\n  metaPayload?: any,\n  action: MetaChainNode\n}\n\nA meta node's action property holds the next link in the chain.\nWhy meta chains?\nThere are 2 main purposes for meta chains:\n\nStore inspectors will be passed the entire chain. Since inspectors are used for logging and recording actions, meta data can contain helpful debugging notes, for example.\n\nMeta chains are a standard way to format meta data so that Zedux can understand it.\n\n\nZedux will ignore any meta types it doesn't understand. But there are some built-in types that Zedux does understand. Sticking one of these types on an action's meta chain basically tags it for Zedux. There are some cool things Zedux can do with these \"tagged\" actions, such as:\n\nTime travel with composed stores. See the store composition guide.\n\nOptimizations/dispatch flow control, such as making an action skip the store's reducer and/or processor layers entirely.\n\n\nNotes\nIn most cases, you really shouldn't add the built-in meta types to actions yourself. Zedux does some action wrapping and unwrapping internally. Just let it do its thing.\n"},"docs/guides/optimizingPerformance.html":{"url":"docs/guides/optimizingPerformance.html","title":"Optimizing Performance","keywords":"","body":"Optimizing Performance\nZedux ships with 4 main methods of performance optimization.\nMemoized selectors\nMemoized selectors are awesome performance tools. They prevent heavy calculations from being performed unless absolutely necessary.\nNote that memoized selectors carry a little bit of overhead. But selectors are declarative and they're also a state shape abstraction. These benefits alone make the overhead of memoization almost never worth worrying about.\nStore composition\nIn Zedux, a store can be composed of other stores. An action dispatched to a store will:\n\nHit the inspector, reducer, and processor layers of that store and all its child stores.\n\nHit the inspector layer of its parent store (and its parent and its parent's parent, etc...).\n\nCompletely ignore all sibling, cousin, uncle, and aunt stores.\n\n\nThis means that given the following store hierarchy:\n    A  dispatching an action to store C will not affect store B in the slightest and will only touch the inspector layer (which is usually the smallest layer) of store A.\nA well-structured store hierarchy will naturally be very performant.\nInducers and store.setState()\n\nDon't use this method as a performance optimization unless you're positive you need it. #prematureoptimization.\n\nInducers and store.setState() have the unique capability of updating any piece of the store in O(1) time. A normal action dispatched to the store is passed through the entire reducer hierarchy to calculate the new state. While this is almost never a big deal, it is an O(n) algorithm.\nInducers and store.setState() can be used to circumvent the reducer hierarchy. Use sparingly – standards are there for a reason.\nNote that this optimization is only possible in stores that are not composed of other stores. When a store is composed of another store, Zedux still shuttles the special partial hydrate action through the reducer layer in order to persist the inducer's imposed state to child stores. Of course, a store will eventually be reached that has no child stores. That store will still update in O(1) time.\nThe SKIP_* meta types\n\nDon't use this method as a performance optimization unless you're positive you need it. #prematureoptimization.\n\nZedux has two special meta types that it uses internally but can technically be accessed. metaTypes.SKIP_REDUCERS and metaTypes.SKIP_PROCESSORS can be used to skip the store's reducer and processor layers, respectively. These will also skip the reducer or processor layers of any child stores.\nThese should almost never be necessary. And they will obviously cause confusing bugs if used incorrectly. Use sparingly.\n"},"docs/api/":{"url":"docs/api/","title":"API","keywords":"","body":"\nact\nact.namespace\nactionTypes\ncreateStore\nmetaTypes\nreact\nselect\nstate\ntransition\nStore\nZeduxActor\nZeduxMachine\nZeduxReactor\nZeduxState\n\n"},"docs/api/act.html":{"url":"docs/api/act.html","title":"act","keywords":"","body":"act()\nA standard tool for creating actors.

Namespacing action types relative to their location in the file tree makes it easy to find action creators and reducers that handle that action type.\n\nSo much easier to read, because:\n\nThe actual \"action\" is obvious.\n\nSub-actions are obvious.\n\nNodes are well-defined.\n\n\n\n\nEasier to read\nCompare the unnamespaced:\n'FETCH_ALL_TODOS'\n'FETCH_ALL_TODOS_REQUESTED'\n\nto the namespaced:\n'todos/fetchAll'\n'todos/fetchAll/requested'\n\nAs opposed to the unnamespaced actions, the namespaced action types make it obvious that:\n\n\"fetchAll\" and \"requested\" are the two actions.\n\n\"requested\" is a sub-action of \"fetchAll\".\n\n\"fetchAll\" is its own node (the double-word node throws off most naming conventions).\n\n\"todos\" is the entity these actions are acting on.\n\n\nGood luck visually or programatically parsing all that from the straight-English unnamespaced action types.\nAvoids collisions\nThere is no ambiguity between these two fetchWeapon action creators:\nimport { fetchWeapon } from './entities/weapons'\n\nimport { fetchWeapon } from './character/currentEquipment'\n\nThe location of these modules in the file path effectively \"namespaces\" these two fetchWeapon functions. But the action types declared in these files have no such benefit:\n// ./entities/weapons.js\nconst FETCH_WEAPON = 'FETCH_WEAPON'\n\n// ./charactor/currentEquipment\nconst FETCH_WEAPON = 'FETCH_WEAPON'\n\nThe conflict here is obvious. If an action with either of these action types is dispatched to the store, the reducers for both will respond to it. This may be an uncommon scenario, but it'll be a big time-waster when it happens to you.\nAll action types live in a global pool. Global stuff is always hard to keep track of. One solution is to move all action types into a single \"actions.js\" file, which makes it easy to see any duplicates. But this isn't necessary.\nIdeally, action types should be colocated with the reducers they're most often meant to trigger. Properly namespaced action types will never conflict.\n"},"docs/api/actionTypes.html":{"url":"docs/api/actionTypes.html","title":"actionTypes","keywords":"","body":"actionTypes\nThere are a few action types that Zedux uses internally.

Thus a store's inspectors can be notified of otherwise unserializable \"actions\".

This means that they will only recompute their value if their input changes. Useful for heavy calculations.\n\n\nDefinition\n(\n  ...inputSelectors: Selector[],\n  calculator: (...args: any[]) => D\n) => Selector\n\nNo, that isn't valid typescript. But:\ninputSelectors - The list of selectors whose output will be fed as input to the calculator function.\ncalculator - A function that takes the output of its selector dependencies as arguments and returns a state derivation.\nExamples\nIf no arguments are passed, select() returns the identity function (state => state).

But I'll assume that if you're reading this, you either do need to know, or you're curious to learn – and who am I to stop you?\nAll selectors perform an initial calculation the first time they're called. But memoized selectors will remember that first value. On subsequent invocations, memoized selectors only recalculate their values when their input changes. There are actually 2 pieces to this:\n\nThe piece that calls all the input selectors passing them the state object (and any other args) and compares their output to the previous output.\n\nThe piece that calls the calculator function, passing it the output of the input selectors.\n\n\nA memoized selector will try to short-circuit as early as possible in this process:\nIf the selector is passed the same arguments, it'll skip steps 1 and 2.\nIf the selector is passed different arguments, it'll run step 1 and check if the output of the input selectors is all the same. If so, it'll skip step 2.\nStep 2 will only be reached in the case of an input argument being different and an input selector returning a different value. This ensures that the potentially heavy calculator function will only be called when absolutely necessary.\nSince all selectors take the store's state as their first (and only required) argument:\nselectIncompleteTodos(store.getState())\n\nmemoized selectors will only reach step 1 when the store's state changes and step 2 if a particular piece of state on which they depend changes.\nNotes\nThere are cases where the selector's arguments need to change frequently. For example:\nconst oneStarMovies = selectByRating(state, 1)\nconst fiveStarMovies = selectByRating(state, 5)\n\nSince we called the selectByRating selector with different arguments, we just killed our memoization. In many situations this is fine. But sometimes we need a workaround.\nThe solution is to create selector factories whose job is to return unique instances of the selector.

Conceptually, a store is a predictable state container that enforces unidirectional data flow. The store's state can only be updated by dispatching actions to it.\nZedux stores are completely synchronous. This means that when an action is dispatched to the store, the action is immediately sent through the reducer layer, which calculates the new state and returns it directly to the dispatch caller.\nZedux stores are composable. A Zedux store is a valid node in another store's hierarchy descriptor.\nZedux stores are created with the createStore() factory.\nMethod API\nstore.dispatch()\nDispatches an action to the store and returns the new state. Dispatched actions can be canceled by inspectors, but the current state (modified or not) will always be returned.\nDefinition\n(dispatchable: Dispatchable) => any\n\ndispatchable - Either an Action or an Inducer. See the Dispatchable type doc.\nExamples\nDispatching a normal action:\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .use((state = '', action) => action.payload || state)\n\nconst newState = store.dispatch({\n  type: 'test',\n  payload: 'new state'\n})\n\nnewState // 'new state'\n\nDispatching an inducer:\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n\nconst newState = store.dispatch(\n  (state = '') => 'new state'\n)\n\nnewState // 'new state'\n\nstore.getState()\nRetrieves the current state of the store. Do not mutate this value.\nDefinition\n() => any\n\nExamples\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .hydrate('initial state')\n\nstore.getState() // 'initial state'\n\nstore.hydrate()\nHydrates the store with the given data.\nCompletely replaces any existing state tree with whatever is passed.\nInternally, this just causes the special hydrate action to be dispatched to the store.\nNote that this won't do any checking to make sure the new state shape is compatible with the current reducer hierarchy. That's your job.\nDefinition\n(newState: any) => Store\n\nnewState - The state to force upon the store.\nReturns the store for chaining.\nExamples\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .hydrate({ weapon: 'dagger' })\n\nstore.getState() // { weapon: 'dagger' }\n\n// Whereas `setState()` merges the partial state update into\n// the existing state...\nstore.setState({ helmet: 'iron' }) /* ->\n  {\n    weapon: 'dagger',\n    helmet: 'iron'\n  }\n*/\n\n// ...`hydrate()` replaces the state tree entirely:\nstore.hydrate({ helmet: 'bronze' })\nstore.getState() // { helmet: 'bronze' }\n\nstore.inspect()\nRegisters a new inspector. Unlike subscribers, inspectors are expected to stick around for the store's entire life. As such, there is currently no way to unregister an inspector. But if you find a use case for that, we'd be happy to hear it!\nDefinition\n(inspector: Inspector) => Inspection\n\ninspector - The inspector to register with the store.\nReturns an Inspection. The inspection's uninspect() method can be used to unregister the inspector from the store.\nExamples\nA simple logger:\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\nconst inspection = store.inspect(logger)\n\nfunction logger(storeBase, action) {\n  console.log('action received:', action)\n}\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'useAntidote'\n})\n// action received: { type: 'useAntidote' }\n\ninspection.uninspect()\n\nstore.setNodeOptions()\nSets the node options that the intermediate nodes in the reducer hierarchy will use to output the state tree.\nDefinition\n(options: NodeOptions) => Store\n\noptions - A hash of node options that teach Zedux how to use the new data type.\nReturns the store for chaining.\nExamples\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\nimport { Map } from 'immutable'\n\nconst nodeOptions = {\n  clone: node => node,\n  create: () => new Map(),\n  get: (node, key) => node.get(key),\n  set: (node, key, val) => node.set(key, val)\n}\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .setNodeOptions(options)\n\nstore.setState()\nApplies a partial state update to the store. The partial state tree will be merged into the existing state tree (immutably, of course).\nWill also trigger the special PARTIAL_HYDRATE action which the store's inspectors can plug in to in order to implement time travel debugging, etc.\nThis is the king of the zero-configuration model of Zedux. Very small apps may want to use this method often and will find extreme joy in its ease of use. Large apps may want to avoid it entirely, sticking to a more pure, Redux-y approach. But that's entirely up to you. You're welcome.\nDefinition\n(partialUpdate: any) => S\n\npartialUpdate - The partial state update to merge into the existing state. Does not have to clone the root node or any nested nodes in the state tree. Zedux takes care of that.\nReturns the new state of the store.\nExamples\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .hydrate({\n    equipment: {\n      helmet: 'iron helm',\n      weapon: 'broadsword'\n    },\n    health: 22\n  })\n\nconst newState = store.setState({\n  equipment: { weapon: 'crossbow' }\n})\n\nnewState /* ->\n  {\n    equipment: {\n      helmet: 'iron helm',\n      weapon: 'crossbow'\n    },\n    health: 22\n  }\n*/\n\nNotice that store.hydrate() returns the store for chaining, while store.setState() returns the new state of the tree. This illustrates the different use cases – store.hydrate() is for setting the initial state of the store or fully wiping/recreating it. store.setState() is for on-the-fly state updates.\nstore.subscribe()\nRegisters a subscriber with the store. The subscriber will be notified when the store's state changes.\nDefinition\n(subscriber: Subscriber) => Subscription\n\nsubscriber - A subscriber function that will be passed newState and oldState when the state changes.\nReturns a subscription. The subscription's unsubscribe() method can be used to unregister the subscriber from the store.\nExamples\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n\nconst subscription = store.subscribe((newState, oldState) => {\n  console.log(`state changed from ${oldState} to ${newState}`)\n})\n\nstore.dispatch(\n  () => 'new state'\n)\n// state changed from undefined to new state\n\nsubscription.unsubscribe()\n\nstore.use()\nThe code splitting wizard of the Zedux realm. Creates or modifies the reactor hierarchy using the configured node options and the passed hierarchy descriptor.\nAfter the reactor hierarchy has been modified, it dispatches a special recalculate action to the store.\nDefinition\n(newHierarchy: HierarchyDescriptor) => Store\n\nnewHierarchy - The new hierarchy descriptor. Will be recursively merged into the existing hierarchy (assuming both the old and new hierarchies are branch nodes) or create it if it doesn't exist.\nExamples\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .use({\n    cart: cartStore,\n    entities: {\n      apparel: apparelReactor,\n    }\n  })\n\n// Oh! They went to the \"toys\" page of our SPA.\n// Load up the \"toys\" reducer and add it to the store.\nstore.use({\n  entities: {\n    toys: toysReducer // yeah, a normal reducer for fun.\n  }\n})\n\nThis will give us a hierarchy that looks like:\n{\n  cart: cartStore,\n  entities: {\n    apparel: apparelReactor,\n    toys: toysReducer\n  }\n}\n\nNote that while Zedux provides this abstraction for you, you can still piece together your own reactor hierarchies like in Redux. Just pass your root reactor to store.use().\nSee the merging hierarchies guide for a more in-depth rundown.\nNotes\nA Zedux store also contains two special symbols:\n\n$$observable - Makes the Zedux store compliant with the proposed observable spec. Yes, this means you can do crazy stuff:\n\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs'\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\nconst state$ = Observable.from(store)\n  .filter(state => state !== 'a')\n  .subscribe(newState => {\n    console.log('the state is not \"a\"! It is:', newState)\n  })\n\nstore.setState('a')\nstore.setState('b')\nstore.setState('a')\n\n// the state is not \"a\"! It is: 'b'\n\n\n$$typeof - Identifies the store internally. This is mostly just important when passing a store as part of a hierarchy descriptor. Zedux won't recognize the store without this property.\n\n"},"docs/api/ZeduxActor.html":{"url":"docs/api/ZeduxActor.html","title":"ZeduxActor","keywords":"","body":"ZeduxActor\nThe actor created by the built-in act() factory.\nA ZeduxActor is a normal actor with a few extra capabilities.\nThe gist\nCreating actors manually is completely unnecessary boilerplate in almost every case.

Also sets the current list of \"from\" states to the passed states. Thus:\nimport { transition } from 'zedux'\n\nconst machine = transition('a')\n  .undirected('a', 'b', 'c')\n\nis essentially a shorthand for:\nimport { transition } from 'zedux'\n\nconst machine = transition('a')\n  .from('a', 'b', 'c')\n  .to('a', 'b', 'c')\n\nDefinition\n(...states: (State | string)[]) => ZeduxMachine\n\nstates - Any number of valid States and/or string state names.\nExamples\nimport { transition } from 'zedux'\n\nconst machine = transition('a')\n  .undirected('a', 'b', 'c')\n\nThis method makes Zedux machines useful for any situation where there are a fixed number of states. For example, the famed visibility filter in the Redux todos example is represented perfectly with a set of undirected state edges:\nimport { createStore, state, transition } from 'zedux'\n\nconst showAll = state('showAll')\nconst showComplete = state('showComplete')\nconst showIncomplete = state('showIncomplete')\n\nconst visibilityFilter = transition(showAll)\n  .undirected(showAll, showComplete, showIncomplete)\n\nconst store = createStore()\n  .use({\n    visibilityFilter\n  })\n\nstore.getState() // { visibilityFilter: 'showAll' }\n\nstore.dispatch(\n  showComplete()\n) // { visibilityFilter: 'showComplete' }\n\nstore.dispatch(\n  showIncomplete()\n) // { visibilityFilter: 'showIncomplete' }\n\nNotes\nIt's helpful to think of Zedux machines as normal graphs, rather than as a DFA, or any type of automaton. Zedux machines don't (currently!) have any notion of an \"accept\" state, for example. This is because there is no set amount of \"input\" (dispatched actions) for Zedux stores.\nThe piece of state controlled by a Zedux machine is always a string!

All entities in a Zedux ecosystem are striving to be shape agnostic. This is impossible in many cases. An adapter basically turns a shape dependency into an adapter dependency.\nLet's take an example.\nWe have a selector, selectEquippedShieldStats whose job is to return the equipment stats of the shield our character currently has equipped. Like all selectors, this selector is shape bound. Since our state is normalized, the selector needs to know two things:\n\nWhere the list of current equipment is stored.\nWhere the list of shield entities are stored.\n\nLet's take the naive approach first:\nconst selectEquippedShieldStats = state => {\n  const equippedShieldId = state.currentEquipment.shield\n\n  return  state.entities.shields[equippedShieldId]\n}\n\nHere we went ahead and caved into the shape bound nature of our selector, plucking stuff willy-nilly off the state tree. Let's be better:\nimport { select } from 'zedux'\n\nconst selectShields = state => state.entities.shields\n\nconst selectEquippedShield = state => state.currentEquipment.shield\n\nconst selectEquippedShieldStats = select(\n  selectShields,\n  selectEquippedShield,\n  (shields, equippedShieldId) => shields[equippedShieldId]\n)\n\nHere we created some adapters, selectEquippedShield and selectShields whose sole job is to know the shape of the state and pluck a piece off of it. Now the selectEquippedShieldStats selector has almost achieved shape agnosticism. Rather than depending on the state tree, he depends on two adapters.\nThe selectEquippedShieldStats selector now has something in common with shape agnostic entities. Apart from being beautifully declarative, the selectEquippedShieldStats selector can now easily be plugged in to any store, given the right adapters.\nThere are many types of adapters. Another type of selector adapter is one that finds the state of a child store in a parent store's state tree and feeds it to selectors in the child store:\nimport { selectWeapons } from './equipmentStore/selectors'\n\nconst equipmentStoreAdapter = selector => state =>\n  selector(state.entities.equipment)\n\nconst selectEquippedWeapon = state => state.currentEquipment.weapon\n\nconst selectEquippedWeaponStats = select(\n  equipmentStoreAdapter(selectWeapons),\n  selectEquippedWeapon,\n  (weapons, equppedWeaponId) => weapons[equippedWeaponId]\n)\n\nShape Agnostic\nA shape agnostic entity does not know the shape of the state. It either doesn't deal with the state, or is handed the piece of state relevant to it and doesn't know where that state came from.\nShape agnostic entities can be re-used in different parts of the store, or in different stores completely.\nShape agnostic entities are preferred to shape bound entities whenever possible.\nExamples: Reactors, reducers, processors, and actors.\nShape Bound\nAntonym of shape agnostic. A shape bound entity knows the shape of the state tree. Shape bound entities must (by default - there are plenty of ways to abstract it out) know where in the state tree the piece of state lives that they need.\nExamples: Selectors, inspectors, inducers, React components, and the hierarchy descriptor.\nShape Relation\nThe relation an entity has with the shape of the state – agnostic or bound.\nMany problems arise from mixing entities with different shape relations. Read up on them here.\nStore Agnostic\nA store agnostic entity does not know which store is using it. Most entities are store agnostic by default, the only exception being the store's own methods.\nStore Bound\nA store bound entity can only interact with a single store.\nExamples: Store methods are store bound. Selectors, actors/action creators, and inducers can all be bound to a single store.\nimport { createStore } from 'zedux'\n\nconst store = createStore()\n\nconst addTodo = text => ({ text, isComplete: false })\n\n// This bound addTodo action creator can only dispatch\n// actions to this one, single store.\nconst boundAddTodo = (...args) => store.dispatch(addTodo(...args))\n\n"},"docs/shapeRelationProblems.html":{"url":"docs/shapeRelationProblems.html","title":"Shape Relation Problems","keywords":"","body":"Shape Relation Problems\nThis is just a page to get creative juices flowing about shape relation problems. All of these are surmountable, but we haven't come up with a clean, simple api for handling any of them yet. Feedback is what we're after here!\nThe problem\nA \"shape relation problem\" is a problem surrounding two or more entities with different shape relations.\nIn all cases, the easiest workaround is to bring both entities to the same level. Unfortunately, this will always necessarily be the lowest level. In other words, this means taking the shape agnostic entity (the \"higher\" level) and making it shape bound (the \"lower\" level).\nThis isn't a big deal in a single-store environment. Since there is only one \"shape\", there is not usually a need to keep entities unaware of it. But Zedux doesn't believe in single stores.\nKeeping entities shape agnostic makes them reusable. This is the better approach. Even shape bound entities should abstract out as much of their boundedness as possible. This is why selectors, for example, are composable; so we can have higher-order selectors that are effectively shape agnostic, composed of many shape bound selectors. This means we can use and reuse them with ease. It also makes for a declarative api.\nEssentially, we're looking for some happy, easy, declarative adapter layer or standard abstraction of some sort that'll allow shape agnostic entities to communicate with specific shape bound entities.\nThe problems\nColocating selectors and reducers.\nThis is a nice thought (first expressed by Dan Abramov himself, I believe) but hasn't been very practical. Selectors are shape bound, while reducers are shape agnostic.\nOn the other hand, this is another argument for inducers. As opposed to reducers, inducers are shape bound. This means that colocating selectors and inducers is easy and natural.\nProcessor shape dependencies\nProcessors are necessarily shape agnostic, but there are cases where a processor needs to know the value of some other piece of state. Currently this is done by adding an inspector to the store that behaves as a shape bound \"processor\". This is just semantically irksome and a little more overhead for code splitting environments than we'd like.\n"}}}
